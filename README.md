## What is MAI?
MAI stands for **Motherly AI** – an app that acts like a mom, without the generational trauma!   
You can:
- **Chat** with MAI about your day, finances, and anything in your life that has meaning. MAI can respond with your mental health in mind.  
- **Take short quizzes** to help MAI understand your personality, stress level, love language, and what makes you "tick" 
- **Get gentle reminders** like “get 30 mins of sunlight” or “schedule a massage” — and add them to your Google Calendar so you can actually implement them into your life. 

Our goal? To make you feel heard, understood, and supported.
